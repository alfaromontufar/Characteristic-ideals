# Characteristic ideals of graphs
Given a graph *G*, we can associate it many matrices, i.e., Incidence, Adjacency, Laplacian, Distance, Distance Laplacian, etc.
Let *M* be one of such matrices, associated with *G*.
The k-th characteristic ideal of *M* is the ideal generted by the *kxk*-minors, determinants of size *kxk*, of the matrix *tI-M*.
The folders contain Gr√∂bner bases of characteristic ideals of matrices over *Z[t]* of all connected graphs up to 9 vertices.
